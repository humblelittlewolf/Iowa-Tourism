The American Gothic House
=========================

Background
----------

Since being painted in 'American Gothic' in 1930 by Iowan artist Grant Wood, the house has become an icon of rural America.
Built in the early 1880s, the house famously inspired the artist when he saw it while visiting Eldon, Iowa. 
According to his earliest biographer, Darrell Garwood, Wood "thought it a form of borrowed pretentiousness, 
a structural absurdity, to put a Gothic-style window in such a flimsy frame house."
After sketching out the house, Wood returned to Cedar Rapids to finish the painting with his sister, Nan Wood Graham, and his dentist, Dr. Byron McKeeby, serving as the models for the figures in the painting.


The House Today
---------------

Today the house is owned by the State Historical Society of Iowa. Located in Eldon in Southeast Iowa, the house welcomes visitors who want to take their picture in front of the famous house. The house has also started to allow tours of the first floor. In June of each year, the town of Eldon holds a Gothic Days festival in honor of Grant Wood and the painting. The house was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.
