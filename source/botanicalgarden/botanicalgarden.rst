About
------
In 1929 a public garden in Des Moines was first formed. After the stock market 
crash, it was hard to make any progress on this tiny garden. However, a Friends 
organization started in 1969, which is what is now known as the Des Moines 
Botanical Center, which finally opened in 1979. This garden was run by the City 
of Des Moines Parks and Recreation Department. In 2004 it changed management to 
the Des Moines Water Works, which renamed it to the Des Moines Botanical and 
Environmental Center. However, that management ended in 2012 and it is now a 
nonprofit organization and titled Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden.
