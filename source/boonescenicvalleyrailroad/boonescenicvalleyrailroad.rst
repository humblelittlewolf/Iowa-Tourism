History of the Boone Railroad
-----------------------------

The railroad line that the *Boone Scenic Valley Railroad* works along was first started in Fraser, Iowa in 1893. At the time of the start of this railroad, trains were still a big part of transportation of goods and services across the plains of the Midwest. When automobiles began to take over for transportation services, the *Boone Railroad Historical Society* was formed. They found the funds to purchase the 11.3 miles of railroad that the Boone railroad operates off of. Thanks to their efforts, the first trip handling passengers was in November of 1983. 

Route of the Railroad
---------------------

The railroad starts by going out of Boone and traveling to the Northwest. The railroad first goes over the High Bridge which stands approximately 156 feet above the Des Moines River. Continuing north, the train goes over the Des Moines River Bridge and then goes through Fraser located just north of the bridge. Before making its way back around, the train goes through the small town of Wolf, Iowa and then makes it way back around to Boone once turned around at Wolf.
