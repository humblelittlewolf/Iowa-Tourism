Eastern Iowa
=============

Eastern Iowa is bordered by the Mississippi River. You can find many water 
activities on this expansive river. The Quad Cities (Davenport, Bettendorf, 
Rock Island, and Moline) also reside across this river. However, there are 
still some attractions to check on your way west such as Herber Hoover 
National Historic Site, McNeill Stone Mansion, American Gothic House, and 
Amana Colonies. Check out some of the sites listed below!
