History of the Park
-------------------
Ledges State Park was proposed as a state park as early as 1914 due to the beauty of the canyons and bluffs that attracted tourists from small, growing local communities. Around the year 1924, Ledges was officially called a state park making it one of the first ones in the state of Iowa. Bridges and stone trails were created in the park in the early 1930s due to the park being frequently flooded by the nearby Des Moines river. Even with the floods, Ledges is still a park favorite by many Iowans and Iowa tourists.

**Trails**:

Ledges, which is one of Iowa's most favorite state parks, has attracted millions of visitors. This is because of one of Ledges' main attractions, four miles of hiking trails. These trails lead up and down steep slopes to scenic views of the park including a well known scenic view, Pea's Creek "canyon". While most of the trails have steep slopes, there is an interpretive trail for beginners that leads to Lost Lake located at the southern part of the park.

**Bicycling**:

Attached to Ledges State Park is the Central State Park Bike Route. This bike route is a 91 mile route which connects Ledges with other state parks in central Iowa like Big Creek State Park and Springbrook State Park. It is Relatively flat, but has a few challenging hills along the way as you make your way through the valleys of the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers.

**River Activities**:

The Des Moines River flows through the west edge of the park and offers fine stream fishing and canoeing opportunities.
