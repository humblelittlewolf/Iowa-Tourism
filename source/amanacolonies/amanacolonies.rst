About
------
| The Amana Colonies are a group of German Pietists settlements. There are seven villages total. They first settled in New York state in what is now the Town of West Seneca. They moved west to east-central Iowa in 1855 in order to live out their beliefs. For almost 80 years they maintained an almost self-sufficient local economy. They imported very little from the U.S. economy. Now, Amana is mainly known for its restaurants and craft shops.
