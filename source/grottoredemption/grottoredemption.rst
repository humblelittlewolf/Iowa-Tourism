Grotto of the Redemption
==========================

Around the turn of the century over one hundred years ago, 
a young German American Catholic priest, stricken with pneumonia, 
vowed to build a shrine to the Virgin Mary if she would heal him of his illness. 
The priest, Father Paul Dobberstein, survived his illness and began to gather various 
rocks and stones in a vast multitude to be used in the construction of a great grotto. 
The grotto was to be built entirely with rocks, precious stones, gems, shells, fossils, 
and concrete, and would  be built by hand by Father Dobberstein, with some additional help, 
from 1912 until his death, 42 years later, in 1954. Construction continues to this day 
on the great grotto, which is considered, by some, to be the largest grotto in the world.
